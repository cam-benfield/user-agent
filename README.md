* If you don't have homebrew installed, go ahead and do that. The best way to do so is via the homebrew site's instructions [here.](https://brew.sh/)
* From here, use `rbenv` to install `ruby 2.7.3`
* `gem install rails`
  * If you run into issues with the rails install and webpacker not installing correctly, `brew install yarn` to get node and nodejs to install, as there seems to be some issues with node installing with ruby/rails.
* `bundle install` - Make sure you don't run into any issues, if you do, please raise this as an issue on the repo.
* `yarn install` - This will allow your rails instance to access the JS runtime when it does get up and running.
* From here, you should have a working local/dev instance of the app. Run `rails server` and you should be good to go!
